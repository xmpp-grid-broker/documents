I find this quote very fitting for our thesis - not only was it our task to decide on options,
but also keep questioning them to find the best possible solution.

A tool we used for this were Architectural Design Decisions.
They supported our path to find good solutions to our problems greatly in my opinion.
The most surprising turn resulting from an architectural decision during the project was our decision to write an Angular application,
which I wouldn't have expected from the task description.

During the project, I often had the feeling that we didn't advance as fast as I had hoped for.
I think the main reason for this were practical limitations, as well as complexity and interdependencies of the underlying XMPP standards.

Working together with Raphael was a very pleasant experience.
Although we often worked remote from home, we had great discussions and conversations.
Nevertheless, I think that it was helpful that we took the time to meet at least one time a week, which improved our communication and team spirit.
