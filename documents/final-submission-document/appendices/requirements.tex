\subsection{Authentication}\label{sec:authentication}
\subsubsection{Login}

As an Administrator,\\
I want to log in\\
- preferably using an existing client \gls{tls} certificate - \\
so that only I can inspect and manage topics.\\

\subsubsection{Secure \gls{xmpp} Authentication}

As an Administrator concerned with security requirements,\\
I want to use either \gls{sasl-external} or \gls{sasl-scram} mechanism for authentication -

\begin{itemize}
    \item preferably the SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS variant and
    \item preferably using mutual certificate-based authentication including revocation status checking
\end{itemize}

\noindent - so that the controller is fully compatible with the \gls{xmpp-grid} standard~\cite{ietf-mile-xmpp-grid-05}.

\noindent To achieve this goal, I am willing to accept:
\begin{itemize}
    \item More costly and less user friendly authentication
    \item limited compatibility of supported \gls{xmpp} servers
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Secure \gls{xmpp} Connection}

As an Administrator concerned with security requirements,\\
I want to use minimally \gls{tls} 1.2 [RFC5246] to communicate with the \gls{xmpp} server at all times\\
to achieve maximal security and compatibility with the \gls{xmpp-grid} standard~\cite{ietf-mile-xmpp-grid-05}.

\subsubsection{Secure Connection}

As an Administrator concerned with security requirements,\\
I want to use minimally \gls{tls} 1.2 [RFC5246] to communicate with the \gls{broker}\\

\subsubsection{Audit Trail}\label{sec:requirement-audit-trail}
