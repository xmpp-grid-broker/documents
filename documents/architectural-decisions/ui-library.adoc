== UI Library

To create a modern and beautiful cross-browser user experience and to reduce the implementation efforts, a UI-library shall be used.

=== Considered Options

* https://material.angular.io/[Angular Material]: Material Design components for Angular
* https://edcarroll.github.io/[Semantic UI Angular 2]
* https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/[Spectre.css] with Custom Components

=== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Spectre.css with Custom Components, because it has minimal third-party dependencies. 

Positive Consequences: 

* from a security point of view, a pure CSS library must not be upgraded.
** An Angular component library might introduce security vulnerabilities (e.g. XSS).
** if the CSS library project is discontinued, the XMPP grid broker application must not necessarily be upgraded

Negative consequences:

* Additional effort are required for the creation and testing of new components
* Angulars component features such as style scoping are not fully utilised
