    * Architectural Decisions
    ** SFF appreciates the current format
    ** We must give more context for non-experts (e.g. what is an XMPP-Bot?)
    * Architectural Decision: Roles
    ** We discussed the pros and cons as described in the Architectural Decision.
    ** The biggest downside is the limited OpenFire support as well as the deferred state of XEP-0248.
    ** SFF ratifies this solution
    * Architectural Decision: XMPP over Websockets/BOSH/Backend
    ** SFF says, that this is an interesting approach to experiment with
    ** We must conduct experiments to ensure that all functionality indeed works as expected
    ** SFF says, that from a security aspect, a new interface is not that bad as long as it uses secure mechanisms such as TLS.
    ** If we decide to use WebSockets/BOSH, we should investigate how an adapter could be implemented
    * Architectural Decision: Client Framework (e.g. React, Vue, Angular)
    ** For SFF, the most important criteria is to not rely on too many third-party dependencies.
    ** Otherwise, use the best tool for the task
    ** The institute has not preferred Framework
